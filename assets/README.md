Guy Van Oers is a self-taught artist whose abstract paintings are driven by emotion and intuition. Working mainly with acrylic on canvas, he creates dynamic compositions full of movement, texture, and layered color. His work explores themes like motion, disruption, and reduced realityâ€”inviting viewers to feel rather than interpret.
